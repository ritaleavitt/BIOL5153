# CONTENTS:
# 1. LeavittCV.md - Copy of my CV
# 2. assn03.tgz - Zipped tape archive of assignment 3 pbs files and output
# 3. write-razor-pbs.py - Python script file for use in the razor cluster created for assignment 4
# 4. write-pinnacle-slurm.py - Python script file for use in pinnacle cluster created for assignment 4
# 5. Assn4.3_output.png - Image of my output from questions 3 of assignment 4. Note that the script would only run 
# when I called python3 scriptname in the scripts file and not anywhere else in the cluster. Below I have attached 
# the bash* files so you can see I did modify the path appropriately. Both bash files loaded when I logged onto razor
# so I don't know why the scripts wouldn't run.

# 6. .bashrc_image.png - Proof that I did modify my .bashrc file in a way that should have modified the path to work.
# 7. .bashrc_image.png - Proof that I did modify my .bash_profile in a way that should have modified the path to work
